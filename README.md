Exercise (work in pairs):
1. One of the pairs forks this repository to their Github account.

2. Invite your pair as a collaborator in Github (its in settings -> Collaborators)

3. Both of check out this repo (it should have an URL like https://github.com/yourName/.. NOT github.com/matyasforian).

4. Both make modifications to this file and try to push it (without pulling first.). You should modify different parts of this file, e.g. someone writes something to the beginning the other to the end. This will cause a merge conflict. Try to solve it, so both modifiations are in this file!
